infrared remote control extender
#description
Extend your 36kHz infrared remote control with this simple tool.
It receives commands and just send it to its infrared LED that can be extended by a cable (ca. 1 meter)
Mount the control where you reach it with your remote control and mount the LED near your device(s).

I just use an old 5V smartphone charger to supply the control:
